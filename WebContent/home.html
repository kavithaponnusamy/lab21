<h4 class="display-4"> My Carrier</h4>
<p class="lead">I want to pursue my career in IT.  I have completed a foreign Bachelor degree in Computer Science Engineering. I am a good listener, as well as a great communicator. I worked as a lecturer in an engineering college. My role was to handle the computer lab and teach the students. I was the class advisor for the third year engineering students. I gave directions to the students to increase their performance on exams. I sent emails to the principal regarding the students' performance. My job included giving directions and helping the students in completing their tasks in the lab.I have three years of experience as a teacher. I adapted to the challenges in the working environment. I collaborated with co-workers. I assisted the students when they were in need.I monitored the studentsâ€™ performance to guide them.

Currently I am completing certification and English training in A+ and Java. This is after I relocated  to the US, took a career break to facilitate adjustment and assist in family transition. I focused on self-study and completed ESL training courses. I received a scholarship to attend Troy Continuing Education: TRAC Professional development program, which includes presentation skills, networking essentials, American work culture, and English for the work-place. I also joined MIWorks! Troy, a job training and placement resource center. I attend professional networking events to increase my knowledge of the local business atmosphere. I enjoy being involved in professional organizations and continuously learning.
